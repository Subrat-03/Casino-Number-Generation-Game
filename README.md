# Casino Number Generation Game
The Casino Number Generation Game operates as an immersive virtual gambling experience with a systematic gameplay structure.
Commencing with player registration, participants are prompted to input their name and an initial deposit amount, thereby establishing their virtual financial stake in the game.
Following registration, players engage in a strategic decision-making process by selecting a number between 1 and 10, subsequently placing a bid from their available deposit.
The game employs a sophisticated Number Generator to produce a random number, serving as the decisive factor in determining the outcome of the player's bet.
In the event of a matching generated number and the player's selection, the player secures a victory, receiving a payout equivalent to 10 times the bid amount. 
Conversely, a lack of alignment results in the forfeiture of the bid amount, subtracted from the player's overall deposit.
Progressing in rounds, players can continually place bets, strategically managing their virtual funds.
Crucially, the game allows players the autonomy to decide when to cease participation, either upon depleting their entire deposit or at a moment of their choosing.
